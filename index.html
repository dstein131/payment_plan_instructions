You may also click on ‘View Agreement’ to display a copy of the payment plan which can be printed and signed by the property owner and a representative for the county.  Once the agreement has been executed, the plan can be scanned and saved back to the Tax Sale System by selecting ‘Save Signed Agreement’ after choosing a file.  After this, at any time, you can go back and select ‘Download Pay Plan’ to download this signed copy of the agreement. <u>NOTE:</u> By completing this process, it does not update the status within the system for the parcel itself. Please refer to the section titled <u>Updating Status within Tax Sale System</u> if the county chooses to update the status once a payment plan is activated.</p>
